# Welcome to My Hugo Blog!

This is my first blog post created with **Hugo** and the beautiful **PaperMod** theme.

## What is Hugo?

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

## Features of PaperMod Theme

The PaperMod theme offers:

- Clean and modern design
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Fast loading times
- Mobile responsive
- Search functionality
- Social media integration
- And much more!

## Getting Started

To create your own posts, simply run:

```bash
hugo new content posts/your-post-name.md
```

Then edit the markdown file and set `draft = false` when you're ready to publish.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
